        Your task is to act as a world-class soccer historian. I will provide a list of players. You must find one or more players who have been an official teammate with EVERY player on this list at some point in their careers (either at a professional club or on a national team).

        List of players to find a common teammate for:
        ---
        ${playerList}
        ---

        Please format your response as follows:
        1. If you find a common teammate, start with a clear summary sentence, for example: "Sergio Busquets has been a teammate with everyone on the list."
        2. Below the summary, provide a bulleted list that proves the connection for each player on the original list. For example:
           - Teammate with Lionel Messi at FC Barcelona (2008-2021) and Inter Miami (2023-Present).
           - Teammate with Andr√©s Iniesta on the Spanish National Team (2009-2018).
           - Teammate with Sergio Ramos on the Spanish National Team (2009-2021).
        3. If no single player has been a teammate with everyone on the list, state that clearly and concisely.
